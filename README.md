## Pion QE Studies

The code for each study can be built separately in the respective directory using CMake. The studies all assume the use of
ROOT files, with flat trees, generated by the `PDSP_analyzer_module.cpp`. More information on the variable definitions
can be found here https://wiki.dunescience.org/wiki/PDSPAnalyzer. 

### 1. `vertex_reconstruction`

Studies of the vertex reconstruction performance in ProtoDUNE. An important ingredient to the pion QE cross section measurement.

###2. `mc_study_1`  

Basic MC study of pion QE events. Study of basic variables such as, pion KE, scattering angle, nucleon multiplicity, etc.
